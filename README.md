In ```run.py``` line 104 I'm running my clean.js file, because I had a problem with string encoding and data cleaning in python. it was injecting these weird ```\u1234``` stuff and I found it easier to just redo the whole thing in Nodejs rather than trying to fix the encoding in Python. I'm a simple man.

## How to run
```python run.py```

## Dependencies
* Python 2.7 or above
* Nodejs (any honorable version)
